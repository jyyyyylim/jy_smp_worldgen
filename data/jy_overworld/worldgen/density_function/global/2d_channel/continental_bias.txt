- layer main continental noise with another layer of noise for actual continents
    - maybe dedicate a channel to "rockiness" which amplifies gradient shifts
        - analogue to geographic "softness" irl, can also modulate biome variants
- spline with small intervals and big value flucts= small trenches
- river func: trenches with undulation and "rootiness" modulated by continental values 
    - if pos, rivers
        - erosion= noise mask: to multiply effect of river and coast carving?
    - if neg, volcanism?
        - or is that governed by fuzzed continent edges?

        
- structure block trees?
    - treefeller addon, when holding special offhand item? (guide to basic physics)
        - amplified axe dura damage
