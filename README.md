# jy_smp_worldgen
 heavily indev. home of jy's idealised smp worldgen: 
 - competently balancing survival-friendliness and coooollll photogenic epic 70IQ slop youtuber bait
 - as faithful to actual geography as possible, appropriately scaled to best-effort 
 - staying vanilla: retaining-reworking as much vanilla biomes as possible and using no modded blocks.
