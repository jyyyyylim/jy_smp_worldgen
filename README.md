# jy_smp_worldgen
 heavily indev. home of jy's idealised smp worldgen: 
 - competently balancing survival-friendliness and coooollll photogenic epic 70IQ slop youtuber bait
 - as faithful to actual geography as possible, appropriately scaled to best-effort 
 - incorporation of balance theories for smp longevity. not elaborating here
 - staying vanilla: 
  - retaining-reworking as much vanilla biomes as possible, using no modded blocks.
  - adding in realworld geographic analogues as best approximated by the exposed config system, when artstyle/"vibes" dont clash with vanilla
 

## usage (tentative)
- this will eventually override vanilla gen. for now, run this:<br>
`execute in jy_overworld at @a ~ ~ ~`

## key progress, urgency descending

- [ ] rivers
- [ ] tectonics and approxs
- [ ] full alloc/realloc of vanilla BB values
- [ ] detailing/vegetal and population work
- [ ] merging in all vanilla biomes
- [ ] master config system (user-friendly world scale control, custom structures et. al.)
- [ ] custom trees?
- [ ] volcanisms?
