# jy_smp_worldgen
 heavily indev. home of the worldgen scheme used in jy's idealised smp: 
 - competently balancing survival-friendliness and cooooooollllll epic top 10 minecraft worldgen ancient addon technology 90 IQ slop youtuber bait
 - as faithful to actual geography as possible, appropriately scaled (best-effort) 
 - incorporation of some balance theories (insofar as worldgen is concerned) for smp longevity. elaborated anywhere but here
 - staying vanilla- feedback welcomed on any deviations: 
   - retaining-reworking as much vanilla biomes as possible, using no modded blocks.
   - adding in realworld geographic analogues as best approximated by the exposed config system, if artstyle/"vibes" dont clash with vanilla
 

## usage (tentative)
- this will override vanilla gen in due time. for now, run this:<br>
`execute in jy_overworld at @a ~ ~ ~`
- you are too smart to need education on how to install a datapack

## key progress, urgency descending
- [x] Just Works
- [x] basic continentalness
  - [ ] less uniformity in terrain master-spline
  - [ ] not everything is acapulco
  - [ ] more work on seabeds
  - [ ] more work on inlands
- [ ] rivers
  - [ ] realistic continental modulation (undulation, deltas, et. al.)
  - [ ] more elaborate erosion schemes... as close as present options could approximate it
- [ ] tectonics and approxs
  - [ ] faultlines
  - [ ] volcanic regions? 
- [ ] full repurposing/realloc of vanilla BB values
  - [x] continentalness
  - [ ] weirdness
  - [ ] ridges
  - [ ] erosion
  - [ ] temperature
  - [ ] vegetation
  - [ ] depth
- [ ] detailing/vegetal and population work
  - [ ] spawning schemes
  - [ ] custom trees?
  - [ ] custom structures?
- [ ] merging in all vanilla biomes
- [ ] master config system (user-friendly world scale control, custom structures et. al.)
